## üêõ Troubleshooting Quick Reference

**Solution:** Check Notion database has entries with Status=Scheduled and Scheduled Time in the past

### Problem: X API authentication fails
**Solution:** Verify all 4 X credentials in GitHub Secrets, check app permissions

### Problem: LinkedIn 401 Unauthorized
**Solution:** Access token expired (60-day limit), regenerate token

### Problem: OpenAI rate limit
**Solution:** Check billing, add credits, or let fallback take over

### Problem: Workflow doesn't run on schedule
**Solution:** Check Actions tab is enabled, verify cron syntax, ensure repo is active

### Problem: "Import could not be resolved" locally
**Solution:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
